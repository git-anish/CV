\begin{cvparagraph}
Iâ€™m an entrepreneur, and a bio-medical engineer. I founded and led SWFTCharge, which I successfully exited. Since the exit I travelled extensively, and have been consulting entrepreneurs on their ventures, and products. I most recently joined Skylight to help grow their new product lines and partnerships following their Series A. I believe my skillset is uniquely suited for a career in Product Management.
